                    <h1>SHORT HISTORY</h1>


                    <ul>


                        <h3>The parish was established in 1910 with Fr. Prince, S.J., as the first parish priest. In 1923, Fr. Raja Athisiyam, S.J., laid the foundation for the church, which was completed by Fr. C. Montaud, S.J., in 1932. </h3>
                        <h3>. Fr. T. Kurieu, S.J., erected the church tower. Fr. Peter Roy improved the presbytery and the school building. Frs. Arul Rayan, B. Pinto, and Francis Xavier worked to elevate the spiritual level of their congregation.</h3>
                        <h3>Fr. Alexis, who served this parish for 18 years, constructed a two-storied building for the school, the grotto for Our Lady of Fatima, and extended the church. Three other significant achievements were made possible after prolonged efforts.</h3>
                        <h3>. Just behind the school, there was an open ground that the Collector was willing to donate to the school to be used as a playground. As soon as the potters heard of it, they claimed it as theirs and built 40 houses on it overnight. It took two and a half years to make them vacate. It was named ‘St. Joseph’s Playground.’ During the tenure of Fr. Lourdu Ubagaram, the golden jubilee of the church was celebrated; he renovated the church and the presbytery, laid a path between the presbytery and the main road, built the compound wall, constructed churches in Thodaneri and Kilamathur, and arranged for an abundant water supply for the students.</h3>
                        <h3>Fr. N.P. Alphonse, who came to this parish in 1983, besides building a chapel in Oormachikkulam and improving the school buildings in Samayanallur and Sholavandan, engaged in direct evangelization with the help of a zealous group. He also started youth associations in villages and paved the way for ecumenism and dialogue. </h3>
                         <h3>He was sensitive to the suffering of the Sri Lankan Tamils and undertook a fast. He conducted a procession of women with empty pots to urge the authorities to take immediate steps for water supply.</h3>
                         <h3>Fr. Lourduraj has numerous achievements to his credit, such as renewing the youth club, building Visuvasam Arangam and Casimir Hall, improving the school roofing, completing the chapel, renewing the altar, initiating Lourdes dispensary in Mannadi Mangalam, and bringing the convent of Pallotine Sisters to Mariammalkulam. With the help of MMSSS, he started the Marianus dispensary in Samayanallur; he decided to provide nutritious food for 1,000 children in Samayanallur and Sholavandan.</h3>
                         <h2>Fr. Benedict Ambrose built a church in Sholavandan in 1993. He replaced the thatched roofs of the schools with tiled roofs. He also built 47 houses for the homeless poor in the substations of Thodaneri, Kilamathur, and Kuranguthoppu (now Vadipatti parish) of Samayanallur with the help of the “Little Way Association” in London. He was instrumental in getting six teaching posts sanctioned for the schools in the parish. A revolving fund for the people was started with a share of Rs 100 in 1990 and is still progressing with a capital of 16 lakhs. He started a dairy farm in 1991. In 1993, Vadipatti parish was carved out of the parish. Fr. Benedict Barnabas celebrated the 75th year of the church’s construction and renovated it. He mobilized the cooperation of teachers in both Samayanallur and Sholavandan and conducted many spiritual activities with their help in the parish, such as offering regular masses for salutation and rectifying many marriages. An office room was constructed, and a bore well with a water tank for drinking and toilet facilities was provided to the school.

                            Fr. Vedamanickam started an English medium in the high school. St. John Britto Nursery & Primary School in Samayanallur was begun by Fr. Vedamanickam. Fr. Edward Francis built school buildings and toilets in Samayanallur and Sholavandan. He erected a bronze flag mast with the help of the parishioners. He also built a church in MGR Nagar and renovated the church in Oormechchikulam. He also built a church in Mannadi Mangalam. Fr. Paul Britto built the grotto and the Sleeping St. Joseph grotto. He also built the presbytery for the priests and a school building in St. Joseph’s Primary School. He also gave a new face to R.C. Middle School, Sholavandan.
                            
                            The present population of the parish is 510 families. Most of the senior citizens reside in Samayanallur, while the educated next generation has moved to Madurai due to better access to occupation and education for their children. The substations of this parish with chapels are Sholavandan, Urmachikkulam, Kilamathur, MGR Nagar, Mannadimangalam, and Thodaneri. Paravai, Paravai Colony, and Mullipallam are the substations without chapels.
